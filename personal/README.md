# Personal Side-Brain

Personal Side-Brain is the private, local-first memory and action system.

The current implementation remains at the repository root for compatibility:

```text
scripts/capture.py
scripts/local_ingest_server.py
memory/
indexes/
workflows/n8n/
infra/personal/
infra/cloudflare/capture-worker/
```

Current responsibilities:

- capture notes, tasks, ideas, and questions;
- append daily inbox entries;
- review and process inbox files;
- optionally call an AI provider for processing suggestions;
- keep long-term memory writes human-confirmed.

Personal research-resource workflows should use the product-neutral Shared Research Core in `shared/research/`, then require review before writing accepted outputs into private memory.

Private memory stays under `memory/` and should not be used by Team Side-Brain.
